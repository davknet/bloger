Laravel and ReactJS Vite Containerization with Nginx Reverse Proxy

This repository provides an example of containerizing a Laravel backend and a ReactJS frontend (powered by Vite) using Docker. It includes an Nginx reverse proxy to serve both applications seamlessly.


Features:
Laravel Backend: A robust PHP framework for building scalable server-side applications.
ReactJS Frontend: A modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces, integrated with the Vite development environment for blazing-fast builds.
Nginx Reverse Proxy: Routes requests to the appropriate service (Laravel or React) based on the URL structure.
Dockerized Environment: Each component runs in its own Docker container for isolated and consistent development.
PostgreSQL Database: Preconfigured to support Laravel's database needs.
Scalable Architecture: Easily extendable for production deployments.
